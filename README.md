# helvetica-calendar

This page draws a calendar for the current month using the famous Helvetica font (if you have it installed, oherwise you might get Arial I guess, or possibly Times New Roman).

It's not a standard calendar layout but I find it good to print out and write on it; there's more horizontal space for each day and no boxes to get in the way.

Anyway, <a href="https://www.toffeemilkshake.co.uk/helvetica-calendar">it's here</a>.
